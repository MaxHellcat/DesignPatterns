// Name: Abstract Factory (object creational), aka Kit
// Intent: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
// Key: Consistency among products
// Notes: To avoid inheriting new factory for each product family we can use a prototype-based approach. Similarly, in dynamically typed languages like Objective-C we can store product classes instead.

// A factory base class may or may not be abstract. In the former case it just defines interface, whereas in the latter it also provides default implementation, allowing sub-factories to only override methods they need.
